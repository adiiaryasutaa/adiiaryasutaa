      "My full name is I Gusti Ngurah Agung Adi Aryasuta, I am usually called Gung Adi or Adi. I am a Software Developer and student. I was born and live in Denpasar, Bali. Currently I am a student at <a class=\"text-slate-700 font-semibold hover:underline dark:text-slate-100\" href=\"https://www.smkn1denpasar.sch.id/\" target=\"_blank\">SMK Negeri 1 Denpasar</a> majoring in Software Engineering. The first time I wanted to learn programming started when I wanted to make games when I was in elementary school. But at that time I didn't know about programming and its ecosystem. Then when I was in grade 9, while I was watching television I saw one of the television programs that discussed a programmer. I'm curious, what is a programmer? After I find out, I understand about programming, programmers, and what it does. Then I realized that my wish when I was in elementary school, which was to make games, could be realized if I learned programming. So I'm looking for a school that has majors that study programming and its ecosystem. I found SMK Negeri 1 Denpasar which has the major, namely Software Engineering.",
      "When I was choosing the first programming language to learn, I watched a <a class=\"text-slate-700 font-semibold hover:underline dark:text-slate-100\" href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZS-MHyEIRo4Ze0bbGB1WKBSNMPzi-eWI\" target=\"_blank\">Belajar C++ Dasar YouTube Playlist</a> from <a class=\"text-slate-700 font-semibold hover:underline dark:text-slate-100\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/KelasTerbuka\" target=\"_blank\">Kelas Terbuka</a> channel. Because I was interested in the explanation, I learned C++ from the playlist. So C++ is the first programming language I learned. But at school I didn't learn C++, instead I learned Java and PHP there which made me rarely continue studying C++ until now. C++ is my favorite programming language, because learning C++ I can learn and understand other programming languages such as Java, PHP, JavaScript, and others quite quickly.",
      "I'm still learning software developer skills. So that I might make mistakes when developing a software. If you want to work with me, want to use my services, or just want to ask me questions, you can contact me through the social media links that I put on the home page."
